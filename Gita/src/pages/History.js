                      Welcome to the journey of our Content Management System
                      (CMS) project that captures the rich history of our
                      college. From inception to realization, our project has
                      evolved to become a platform that showcases our
                      institution's legacy. Here's a glimpse into our story:

                    <h2 className="size-6 color-dark-blue fw-normal">Genesis of the Idea:</h2>
                    <p className="size-7">
                      Our project was born from the vision of creating a digital
                      repository that preserves the history and accomplishments
                      of our college. The idea was to provide an accessible and
                      organized platform for students, faculty, and alumni to
                      engage with the institution's heritage.

                    <h2 className="size-6 color-dark-blue fw-normal">
                      Development and Collaborative Efforts:
                    </h2>
                    <p className="size-7">
                      With a dedicated team of developers, designers, and
                      content creators, we embarked on a collaborative journey.
                      Countless hours were spent designing the user interface,
                      developing the backend, and curating content to ensure a
                      seamless and enriching user experience.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="size-6 color-dark-blue fw-normal">Evolution of Features:</h2>
                    <p className="size-7">
                      As our project took shape, we incorporated features that
                      allow users to explore a variety of historical content.
                      From photo archives and articles to videos and interactive
                      timelines, our CMS project has grown to encompass diverse
                      forms of media.

                    <h2 className="size-6 color-dark-blue fw-normal">Capturing Milestones:</h2>
                    <p className="size-7">
                      Throughout the development process, we celebrated
                      significant milestones. From the first line of code to the
                      beta testing phase, each step brought us closer to our
                      goal of creating a digital time capsule that captures the
                      essence of our college.

                    <h2 className="size-6 color-dark-blue fw-normal">Unveiling and Future Directions:</h2>
                    <p className="size-7">
                      Today, we proudly unveil our CMS project to the college
                      community and the world. However, this is just the
                      beginning. We envision continuous updates, enhancements,
                      and expansions as we aim to create a dynamic and living
                      repository that continues to tell our college's story.
