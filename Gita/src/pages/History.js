                      Welcome to the journey of our Content Management System
                      (CMS) project that captures the rich history of Bhagavad
                      gita. From inception to realization, our project has
                      evolved to become a platform that showcases our
                      institution's legacy. Here's a glimpse into our story:

                      Genesis of the Idea:
                    </h2>
                    <p className="size-7">
                      Our project was born from the vision of creating a digital
                      repository that preserves the history and accomplishments
                      of Bhagavad gita and onther gita's. The idea was to
                      provide an accessible and organized platform for students,
                      faculty, and alumni to engage with the institution's
                      heritage.

                      Development and Collaborative Efforts:
                    </h2>
                    <p className="size-7">
                      With a dedicated two-person team of developers, designers,
                      and content creators, we embarked on a collaborative
                      journey. Countless hours were spent designing the user
                      interface, developing the backend, and curating content to
                      ensure a smooth and rich user experience.

                    <p className="size-7">
                      As our project unfolded, we integrated a number of
                      features designed to facilitate users in exploring a wide
                      range of historical content.{" "}

                      Throughout the development process, we commemorated
                      noteworthy milestones. From the inception of the first
                      line of code to the beta testing phase, each stride
                      propelled us forward in our mission to craft a digital
                      time capsule that captures the essence of our dedication
                      to two remarkable individuals.
